## **Introduction**

The Mediator Design Pattern is a pattern that provides a central authority through which the different components of an application may communicate. 

When a Mediator is added to the system, all of the objects can be greatly simplified:
- They tell the Mediator when their state changes,
- They respond to requests from the Mediator.

Before adding an Admin as a Mediator, all of the participants needed to know all the rules about receiving messages of each otherâ€¦ it accidentally makes them all tightly coupled. With the Mediator in place, the participant objects are all *completely decoupled* from each other.

The Mediator contains all of the control logic for the entire system.

When an existing participant needs a new rule, or a new participant is added to the system, you will know that all of the necessary logic will be added to the mediator.
